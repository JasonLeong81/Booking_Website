### Caching : DRAM (uses capacitors to store information but need to be refreshed) and SRAM (expensive but fast)



### Features to implement: notifications, auto delete, advertisement structure, different chat rooms, finish setting up your account (gender),
### pending: profile picture (need to avoid hard refresh), for "shopping list" if the last edited date is today then only show the time, improve hair cut booking in test
### just done: migration on heroku (migrate and upgrade locally first and then only commit to git )
